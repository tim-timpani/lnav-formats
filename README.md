# File Formats for lnav
This repo contains customized file formats for use with lnav
log file navigator (http://lnav.org)

Add each desired file to ~/.lnav/formats/installed/ directory

NOTE: My formats omit the year so that some log formats
with timestamps that do not have a year can be viewed with
others that do and still be in timeline order.
